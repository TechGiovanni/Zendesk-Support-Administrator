<h2>Our example company "itsolutions"</h2>

The scalability of your setup highly depends on the early planning phase. Before we can go through the process of such an evaluation, we need to establish a far-reaching scenario by creating a fictitious example company. For the sake of simplicity and not having to refer to the company as an example throughout this lab, we will call it itsolutions.

itsolutions is a Canadian tech company selling their own software online. They also offer some hardware created by a third-party in order to guarantee better compatibility and support.

Next to offering their software for individual purchase, customers can choose a yearly subscription allowing them access to the full range of software solutions. These customers are called "VIPs" and can purchase the hardware to a discounted price. As part of the subscription, VIP customers are supposed to receive faster responses from the support team.

itsolutions is still considered a start-up and cannot afford to provide customer-service in more than two languages (English and French), but are planning to offer support in more languages later on.
